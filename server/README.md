UpGrad-Yogini AI Image Generation Tool 

#################### Introduction ###############################

This project is an AI image generation tool built with OpenAI and the MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack, Cloudinary, and Frontend using Tailwind and Vite. The tool is designed to allow users to generate high-quality images using AI algorithms and share their Creativity amongst others in the community. 

#################### Features ###############################

• Generates high-quality images using OpenAI's image generation algorithms. 
• Provides a user-friendly interface for selecting and configuring the generation algorithm. 
• Gives you an opportunity to download others generated images 
• Share the generated image with the Community 


#################### Technologies Used ###############################

• MongoDB: A document-oriented database used to store user settings and image data. 
• Express: A web application framework used to build the API that interacts with OpenAI's image generation API. 
• React: A JavaScript library used to build the user interface. 
• Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used to execute server-side code. 
• OpenAI: An AI platform used to generate high-quality images. 
• Tailwind: A utility-first CSS framework used to style the user interface.
